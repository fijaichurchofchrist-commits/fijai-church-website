## 2-Minute Decision Guide

### Question 1: How often will you upload documents?

**Once a month or less**
→ Use **Google Drive** (simpler)

**Weekly or more**
→ Use **Firebase** (better long-term)

---

### Question 2: Are you comfortable editing JSON files?

**Yes, I can edit files**
→ Use **Google Drive** (5 min setup)

**No, I want a web interface**
→ Use **Firebase** (15 min setup, then super easy)

---

### Question 3: How many people will upload documents?

**Just me**
→ Use **Google Drive** (simple for solo)

**2-3 people**
→ Either works (slight edge to Firebase)

**4+ people**
→ Use **Firebase** (multiple logins)

## Time Comparison

### Google Drive
- Setup: 0 minutes
- Per upload: 5 minutes
- Total for 10 uploads: 50 minutes

### Firebase
- Setup: 15 minutes (one-time)
- Per upload: 2 minutes
- Total for 10 uploads: 35 minutes

**Firebase saves time after ~30 uploads**

---

## My Recommendation

### Start with Google Drive
1. Works immediately (0 setup)
2. Test your website with real content
3. See if you even need Firebase
4. Switch later if you want

### Upgrade to Firebase when:
- Uploading becomes frequent
- JSON editing gets annoying
- Multiple people need access
- You want the admin panel

## What I'd Do

If this was my church:

**Week 1:**
- Deploy website with sample data
- Get it live ASAP

**Week 2:**
- Upload 2-3 real sermons via Google Drive
- Test with congregation

**Month 2:**
- If uploading weekly → Set up Firebase
- If uploading monthly → Keep Google Drive

**Result:** Best of both worlds
